This release incorporates all changes in the upstream play template compiler that accumulated since the
original extraction in 2012. Most notably, twirl now supports sbt 0.13 in addition to sbt 0.12! Also,
several issues that still plagued the twirl version but that were fixed in play should now be fixed.

Others:
  * A new setting `twirlRecompilationLogger` allows to customize the logging behavior of the sbt-twirl plugin.

Note: You need to add `resolvers += "spray repo" at "http://repo.spray.io"` to your `plugins.sbt`.
